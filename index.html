<p>My name is Thomas Ard. I am a freshman here at IIT. Eventually, I want to enroll in the co-terminal accelerated master degree program for a bachelor degree in ITM and a master degree in applied cybersecurity and cyberforensics.</p>
<p>My educational background consists of both a high school diploma and Associate Degree of Interdisciplinary Studies from the Gatton Academy. Gatton is an early-college academy in Kentucky, where I'm originally from, that allows students to complete their high school requirements and earn an associate degree at WKU at the same time.</p>
<p>Besides that, I have several hobbies, such as gaming, listening to music, and chess. I invested quite a bit of time into chess, which culminated in me reaching the top 1% of players on chess.com (the largest online chess website), although I'm probably not quite as good anymore.
  As for gaming, my favorite game is Minecraft, but I play lots of other games, including Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I actually play Ultimate competitively and am ranked 76th in Kentucky as of May of this year. Finally, I enjoy most kinds of music. My favorite genres are pop-punk, rock, and nu metal, and my favorite band is Paramore.</p>
